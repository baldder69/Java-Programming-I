# Part II
Part II goes over recurring problems and patterns to solve them, loops, and methods.

⠀Sections⠀| Learning Objectives |
------------------------- | --------------- |
 Section 1 | <ul><li>You recognize that certain sub-problems, such as reading input or calculations, recur in programs.</li><li>You're aware of solution models to certain sub-problems.</li><li>You practice combining solution patterns used on sub-problems to solve broader ones.</li></ul>
 Section 2 | <ul><li>You are familiar with loops and know how to create a program that contains one.</li><li>You know how to use the break command to end a loop's execution.</li><li>You know how to use continue command to return to the beginning of a loop.</li><li>You are able to create a program that reads inputs from a user until a specific input is given. For example, the number 0 or the string "end", after which the program prints something about the provided inputs (e.g., the input count, and in the case of numbers their sum and average).</li><li>You're familiar with the condition of the while loop condition.</li><li>You know how to use the for loop.</li><li>You recognize situations where a while loop should be used and those where a for loop is more appropriate.</li></ul>
 Section 3 | <ul><li>You are familiar with the concepts of a method parameter, a method's return value, and a program's call stack</li><li>You know how to create methods and how to call them from both the main program (the main method) as well as from inside other methods.</li><li>You can create parameterized and non-parameterized methods, and you can create methods that return a value</li></ul>
